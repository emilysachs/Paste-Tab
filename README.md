# PasteQuery
PasteQuery is a simple Chrome extension that grabs any text currently copied to the user's clipboard and creates a search for it in a new tab.

PasteQuery is run by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+E** or **Command+Shift+E** on Mac.

Upon first install you must either open a new content page or refresh your current page to initiate PasteQuery.
